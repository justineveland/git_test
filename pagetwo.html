    <p><a href="pagetwo.html">Perspective Communications</a></em></strong> was born out of the desire to deliver high quality marketing and communications services to small and intermediate businesses at affordable prices.</p>
<p>We achieve this by automating where appropriate, trimming out any unnecessary fat in our service packages and sticking to the work that we do best. Knowing our client's - <em>and our own</em> - strengths and weaknessess allows us to offer the right service at the right time, so that they can grow and scale profitably.</p>

    <p>When working with Perspective, every customer will feel as though they are our only focus.</p>
    <!--I don't know what I'm doing yet, but this is a decent tutorial and I'm excited to continue learning. I will leave this here for future me, and any other developer that happens across my site. I assume it will give us all a chuckle.-->
